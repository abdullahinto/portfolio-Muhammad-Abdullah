Welcome to my portfolio website! I am a junior Python developer with a strong interest in backend logic and development. This website showcases my expertise and projects in backend development using Python.

## About Me

I am passionate about creating efficient and scalable backend systems. My main programming language is Python, and I am currently exploring the Flask framework to enhance my skills. I enjoy developing programs that leverage Python's capabilities and am always eager to learn new technologies.

1. **TEFI Flask App**:A Flask web app that extracts text from uploaded images using OCR technology, enabling users to upload images and view extracted text instantly.
3. **Flask CRUD API**: RESTful API with Flask offering CRUD operations, JSON responses, and robust error handling.Features input validation and optional MongoDB integration. Built for efficient data management with clear endpoints.
